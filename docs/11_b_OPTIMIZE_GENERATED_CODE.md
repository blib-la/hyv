# Enhancing Code Quality with Hyv's Multiple Agents

## Overview

Following the setup of the `developer` and `optimizer` agents in the first part of the guide, this
tutorial aims to demonstrate how these agents can be utilized to generate and optimize code.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes successful completion of the preceding guide "Establishing Dual Agents for Code
Development in Hyv" where the `developer` and `optimizer` agents were configured.

## Guide

### Assigning Tasks to Agents for Code Optimization

In this step, a task will be assigned to the `developer` agent. The output of the `developer` will
then be optimized by the `optimizer` agent.

```typescript
try {
    const raw = await developer.assign({
        goal: "The matrix code",
        boilerplate: minify`
        const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
        const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

        function setCanvasSize() {
          canvas.width = window.innerWidth * devicePixelRatio;
          canvas.height = window.innerHeight * devicePixelRatio;
        }

        setCanvasSize();
        window.addEventListener("resize", setCanvasSize, {passive: true});
        `,
    });
    await optimizer.assign(raw.message);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
}
```

In this example, the `developer` agent is tasked to construct "The matrix code" using a provided
boilerplate. The `optimizer` agent then steps in to review the output generated by the `developer`
and optimizes it accordingly. The `sideEffects` of the `optimizer` agent are configured to extract
and log the code.

## Summary

By leveraging the capabilities of Hyv's multiple agents, this guide demonstrates how to boost the
quality of the generated code. Through this process, the final output is not only produced but also
scrutinized, refined, and optimized, leading to enhanced code quality.
