# Streamlining AI Behavior with Lingo and Personas in Hyv

## Overview

This guide aims to showcase how Lingo and persona settings can be utilized to generate concise and
intuitive instructions for AI behavior in Hyv. We'll explore the application of Lingo for building
specific instructions and the process of configuring personas.

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this guide, a foundational understanding of JavaScript or TypeScript, the Hyv
library, and AI personas is beneficial. Also, familiarize yourself with Lingo syntax using the
[Lingo GitHub repository](https://github.com/failfa-st/lingo).

## Guide

### Crafting Instructions Using Lingo

With Lingo, we can craft intricate instructions for our AI. Here are two examples demonstrating its
usage:

```typescript
// Description with equal emphasis on two terms, followed by keywords and a specific illustration style.
"description(~{{term1}} + ~{{term2}}) + keywords(comma separated) + {{illustrationStyle}}";

// Unique tweet with specific character, hashtag, emoji, and image counts.
"Write a UNIQUE hilarious tweet WITH characters:length(~{{characterCount}}) AND hashtags:length(~{{hashtagCount}}), emojis:length(~{{emojiCount}}), images:length(={{imageCount}})!";
```

### Configuring a Persona

Next, create a persona that outlines your AI's attributes such as name, profession, and
characteristics:

```typescript
const persona = {
    name: "Comedic Writer",
    profession: "Twitter trend expert",
    characteristics: ["humorous", "insightful"],
};
```

### Generating Instructions with Lingo and Persona

Combine Lingo and your persona to generate comprehensive instructions for your AI using
`createInstruction` function:

```typescript
const systemInstruction = createInstruction(
    persona,
    minify`
        Follow instructions closely!
        Write a tweet with hashtags and emojis.
        `,
    {
        decision: "very detailed elaborative string",
        tweet: "Did you know {(comparison)}, because {{term1}} â€¦ {{term2}} ?",
        images: [
            {
                prompt: "description(~{{term1}} + ~{{term2}}) + keywords(comma separated) + {{illustrationStyle}}",
            },
        ],
    }
);
```

## Summary

The blend of Lingo and personas in Hyv provides a powerful and flexible method to guide your AI's
behavior. By crafting detailed instructions, you can ensure your AI aligns with the intended persona
and yields optimal responses.
