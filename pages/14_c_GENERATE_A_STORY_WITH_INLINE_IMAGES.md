# Generating and Verifying an Illustrated Story with Hyv, OpenAI GPT and DALL-E

## Overview

In the third and final part of this guide, we will learn how to execute the agents, generate our
story with illustrations, and verify the output.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have followed the steps outlined in both the first part, "Initial Setup for Generating
Illustrated Stories with Hyv, OpenAI GPT and DALL-E," and the second part, "Generating and
Illustrating a Story with Hyv, OpenAI GPT and DALL-E."

## Guide

### Initiating the Sequence and Story Generation

Having prepared our agents, we can now start the sequence to create our story:

```typescript
try {
    await sequence(
        {
            task: "provide information about the story",
            competitionRules: {
                wordCount: 500,
                chapterCount: 1,
                imageCount: 3,
                maturityRating: "G|PG|PG13",
            },
        },
        [bookAgent, author, illustrator]
    );
    console.log("Done");
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
}
```

### Executing the Script

Save the script in a `.ts` (TypeScript) file and execute it using the `ts-node` command. If you
don't already have `ts-node`, you can install it via npm:

```bash
ts-node your_script_file.ts
```

### Verifying the Output

After running the script, you should verify the output directory, which is
`examples/output/auto-book/` in [our example](../examples/auto-book.ts). You should find a story
crafted by the `author` agent, complete with reading time and word count, and images generated by
the `illustrator` agent, inlined within the story.

### Handling Errors

In case of any errors during the script execution, they will be logged to the console, thanks to the
try/catch block surrounding the sequence function.

## Summary

This guide covered the process of executing AI agents to generate an illustrated story using Hyv,
OpenAI's GPT-4, and DALL-E. By following these steps, you can create engaging narratives with
accompanying illustrations.
